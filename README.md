# Formation
**Here you'll find some of the exercises and small projects I've carried out throughout my training in machine learning, and more specifically in deep learning for computer vision.**


## First Formation: UCSanDiegoX: DSE220x Machine Learning Fundamentals 

### Learning Objectives
This course is an intensive introduction to the most widely-used machine learning methods. The primary goals of the course are to:
* **Provide a Basic Intuitive Understanding**: Gain insights into what machine learning techniques are good for, how they work, how they relate to one another, and their strengths and weaknesses.
* **Hands-On Experience**: Develop practical skills by experimenting with suitable datasets using Jupyter notebooks, allowing for a tangible understanding of these methods.
* **Deepen Theoretical Knowledge**: Explore the mathematical underpinnings of machine learning methods to understand them at a deeper level. This knowledge is crucial for adapting, modifying, and creatively combining existing methods.

**I audited this course and committed to completing it. I believe this is an excellent online course on the fundamentals of ML, as it strikes the right balance between theory and programming. Below are two exercises from this formation. They may not be the most efficient solutions, but they are correct and demonstrate my learning process.**

## Second formation : Learn the Basics — PyTorch Tutorials

### Learning Objectives
This course provides an introduction to PyTorch, one of the most popular deep learning frameworks. The primary goals of this tutorial series are to:
* Gain familiarity with PyTorch’s tensors and automatic differentiation capabilities.
* Understand the fundamental building blocks of neural networks and how to implement them using PyTorch.
* Learn how to use PyTorch for various machine learning tasks, including data loading, model building, and training.

**I followed this course to deepen my understanding of deep learning frameworks and practical implementation. It helped bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical skills, making it easier to build and train neural networks.**

### Project: CNN on MNIST Dataset
As part of this training, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the MNIST dataset. This project showcases the application of the concepts learned in the tutorial series and highlights my progress in the following areas:
* **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Efficiently loading and normalizing the MNIST dataset using PyTorch's data utilities.
* **Model Building**: Implementing a CNN architecture, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
* **Training and Evaluation**: Training the CNN model on the MNIST dataset, and evaluating its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Performing grid search to find the best set of hyperparameters for optimal model performance.

The project provides a practical demonstration of how to build and train a neural network for image classification tasks. You can find the complete code and detailed explanations in this repository.
